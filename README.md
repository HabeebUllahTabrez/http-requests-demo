## Demo Website which uses HTTP protocols to fetch, post and modify data on a webserver

All the posts which were in the project were fetched from jsonplaceholder website:
[https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/](url)

You can view the reqests made by viewing the Networks section in your browser developer tools.

Fetching the posts uses the GET method to fetch data from the server
Adding the posts uses the POST method to send data to the server
Deleting the posts uses the DELETE method to delete data from the server

Apart from these, there are other methods which perform specific tasks 

This website is open sourced so If you guys find that this website needs improvements, you can make changes and improve it!
This is just a dummy website:))
